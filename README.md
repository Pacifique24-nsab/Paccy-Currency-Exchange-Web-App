👨‍💻 Author
Developed by Paccy Developer.

The Web Exchange Currency App, developed by Paccy Developer, is a lightweight web application built with HTML, JavaScript (script.js), and CSS (style.css).
It allows users to:
- View various possible exchange rates around the world.
- Enter a custom amount and instantly see the converted value.
- Track the currency trend of the last 30 days to understand real-time market behavior.
This app provides clarity and transparency for anyone interested in monitoring global currencies.

🚀 Features
- Global Exchange Rates: Displays multiple exchange rates from different countries.
- Custom Input Conversion: Users can input any amount and see its converted value.
- 30-Day Currency Trends: Visualizes the past month’s currency per- formance to highlight fluctuations.
- Real-Time Updates: Ensures the displayed data reflects the current financial situation.

- HTML → Provides the structure of the app.
- CSS (style.css) → Handles styling, layout, and responsive design.
